            <h3>What is Webdevelopment?</h3>
            <p>
                In a few words, web development involves the creation and maintenance of websites. By "website," we mean a collection of web pages that are publicly accessible on the internet.Modern web development also includes web applications. Web applications are software packages that run on a web server and are accessed through the internet. This is unlike a traditional application that runs on your computer, tablet, or phone.

            <h3>Who is A Webdeveloper?</h3>
            <p>
                A web developer or programmer is someone who takes a web design - which has been created by either a client or a design team - and turns it into a website.They do this by writing lines and lines of complicated code, using a variety of languages. Web developers have quite a difficult job, because they essentially have to take a language we understand, such as English, and translate it into a language that a computer understands, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

            <h3>Why I Want To Become A <span class="colored-font">Webdeveloper</span></h3>
            <p>
                Web development itself and how it is done has changed greatly over the years, but one thing has remained the same: web development is about creating applications which run in a web browser. Some of those applications have most of their logic living on a web server which renders HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an application.Webdevelopment is my passion.I like to write code and enjoy it so much.
